# Repository for the Kubernetes + Health probes lab

## Implementing Health Probes to Monitor Container Health

## Overview
In this lab, you, as a Kubernetes application developer, are tasked with ensuring the reliability and availability of a web application running on Kubernetes. The application sometimes experiences downtime due to issues with the containers. To handle this, you will use health probes and checks to monitor the container's health and automatically detect and correct any failures. Using liveness and readiness probes, you will configure the Kubernetes cluster to run periodic health checks on the container. 

## Learning Objectives
Implement liveness and readiness health probes.
Design health checks for containers to manage failure situations. 
Deploy and monitor container health. 

## What will you learn?
Health probes in Kubernetes.
Liveness and Readiness health checks.
Configure health probes for a container in Kubernetes. 
Updating Kubernetes manifests to support health probes. 

## Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Kubernetes and containerization concepts. 
Basic knowledge of health probes in Kubernetes. 
Familiarity with YAML syntax and RESTful APIs.
